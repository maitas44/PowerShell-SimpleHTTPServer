For Linux servers, when I need to expose a file for other VMs to download I usually export them using "python3 -m http.server 8080" and it exports the files in the current directory using http protocol at 8080 port.

For Windows Servers that do not have python install I ask Gemini to create a PowerShell equivalent.

The code is in the Start-SimpleHttp.ps1 file.

You need to open 8080 port. PowerShell line is:

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow TCP 8080 Inbound (Simple HTTP Test)" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8080 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -Profile Any -Description "Allows8080"

Needs to be run:
.\Start-SimpleHttp.ps1 -Port 8080

PowerShell as admin. Port 8080 needs to be open. There needs to be a route to 8080.
